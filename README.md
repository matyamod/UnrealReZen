A tool for creating and packing Unreal Engine .Utoc and .Ucas files.
> [!NOTE]
> This tool is only for ZenLoader archive files. The files inside the archive (like *.uasset) are not within the scope of this tool. Please do not create an issue for these files!

## How it works
First, it is better to know how ZenLoader files work
ZenLoader consists of two parts
- .utoc, which stands for Unreal table of contents, contains the information of the assets, such as ID, offset, size, etc.
- .ucas, which contains the content of Assets in compressed or raw form

The important point of this structure is that you cannot add a new Asset to the game because each Asset contains a unique ID. And due to this unique ID, the tool must first read the game archives and then create the new archive.

The tool checks the game archives using the [CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse) library and after receiving the required information of the Assets, it creates a patch based on your edited files.
## Usage

```console
> UnrealReZen.exe --help
UnrealReZen 1.0.0
Copyright (C) 2024 UnrealReZen
USAGE:
Making a patch for a ue5 game:
  UnrealReZen.exe --content-path C:/Games/MyGame/ExportedFiles --compression-format Zlib --engine-version GAME_UE5_1
  --game-dir C:/Games/MyGame --output-path C:/Games/MyGame/TestPatch_P.utoc

  -g, --game-dir          Required. Path to the game directory (for loading UCAS and UTOC files).

  -c, --content-path      Required. Path of the content that the you want to pack.

  -e, --engine-version    Required. Unreal Engine version (e.g., GAME_UE4_0).

  -o, --output-path       Required. Path (including file name) for the packed utoc file.

  -a, --aes-key           AES key of the game (only if its encrypted)

  --compression-format    (Default: Zlib) Compression format (None, Zlib, Oodle, LZ4).

  --mount-point           (Default: ../../../) Mount point of packed archive

  --help                  Display this help screen.

  --version               Display version information.
```
Some important notes :
- You DON'T have to pack the WHOLE ARCHIVE that you wanna patch! just put the assets that you wanna patch
- This tool DOESN'T support extracting assets from ZenLoader archives. use [FModel](https://github.com/4sval/FModel).
- This tool supports multi archive patching. check example section.
- For games that have archive signature (.sig file for each utoc) this tool doesn't work until you bypass the sig loader.
- Utoc structure can be different in games (unlikely) and your patch may not be loaded by the game and I don't have enough time to support all the games in the world.



## Examples
Lets mod a game. For example i wanna mod two assets in "The Casting of Frank Stone".
- `pakchunk3-Windows.utoc/SMG037UE5/Content/Animations/Cinematics/curiosity_howmuch.uasset`
- `pakchunk7-Windows.utoc/SMG037UE5/Content/Animations/Cinematics/warning_reset_CHRISEND_CHILD_BODY.uasset`

I will export the assets with FModel, edit them and put them in a folder that I named MyPatchedContent (with same path root for each asset).
- `MyPatchedContent/SMG037UE5/Content/Animations/Cinematics/curiosity_howmuch.uasset`
- `MyPatchedContent/SMG037UE5/Content/Animations/Cinematics/warning_reset_CHRISEND_CHILD_BODY.uasset`

Now Because the game is UE 5.1 and its not encrypted I run the tool with this args :

```console
UnrealReZen.exe --content-path C:/TheCastingofFrankStone/MyPatchedContent --compression-format Zlib --engine-version GAME_UE5_1 --game-dir C:/TheCastingofFrankStone/SMG037UE5/Content/Paks  --output-path C:/TheCastingofFrankStone/SMG037UE5/Content/Paks/MyPatch_P.utoc
```
This will make three files (MyPatch_P.utoc / MyPatch_P.ucas / MyPatch_P.pak) in the "C:/TheCastingofFrankStone/SMG037UE5/Content/Paks/" folder. Now I can run the game!

*To find out the version of Unreal Engine used in a game, just check the version of the bootstap executable file of the game (executable file that is in the root of the game folder)
